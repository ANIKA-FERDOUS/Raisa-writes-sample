    <p>Teenage is a phase when we take our parents' company for granted. And I was no exception. There was a time when I used to be upset with my parents over not letting me have iftaar with my friends as often as I wanted to. It was just the three of us. Mum, Papa, and me. I never thought of it as anything special until Papa passed away. After that, it was just Mum and me.
The house had never felt more desolate, and Ramadan, never lonelier. The both of us used to spend this holy month in a state of emotional turmoil remembering the times when the three of us were together. Now, marrying me off has made mum live a solitary life. And even though I so badly want to have iftaar with her, the fact that we live hundreds of miles apart has rendered me helpless. The only thing constant in all of these stages of my life seems to be grief.
However, upon reflection, I realized that's exactly where the fault lies. If only, instead of dwelling over the past, we learn to enjoy the present knowing that circumstances may not be the same in future, we'd be a lot more grateful and put in a great deal of effort to cherish what we have at the moment rather than mourning over the things that we don't anymore.
Consequently, an optimistic approach as such is the sole way in which one can steer away from the misery that lies within. Now, I've learnt to appreciate the existence of the people who are around me rather than aching over the life that I've left behind.</p>
